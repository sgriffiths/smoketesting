	|The four Australian charities currently supported by the Flight Centre Foundation are non-political and receive limited or no support from any government or corporate bodies. They include Bush Heritage Australia (dedicated to protecting Australia's unique animals, plants and habitats), Foodbank Australia (distributes donated and surplus food from the food and grocery industry to welfare and community agencies that provide food assistance to people in need), Redkite (supports children and young people with cancer) and Youngcare (working to get young people with high-care needs out of aged care).|
	|The Foundation is currently committed to our partners - Bush Heritage, Foodbank, Redkite and Youngcare. When we are able to extend our support beyond these relationships, details will be provided on this site.|

	Then I click "Donate Now"
