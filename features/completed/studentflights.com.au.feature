Feature: Feature: smoke test the Student Flight AU production and Acquia Test sites
	In order to verify that the site is up and working to some degree
	As a website user
	I need to check various pages and page elements to confirm this

Background: All test to start at the homepage
	Given I go to the page "Sfau Home Page"
	And I should not see "Sorry, the page you were looking for could not be found."
